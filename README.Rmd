The goal of scScorer is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of scScorer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r}
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

library(scScorer)
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
InstallData("pbmc3k")
data("pbmc3k")
res1 <- ProbScorer(pbmc3k@assays$RNA@counts, PathwaySet = "Metabolism")

InstallData("ifnb")
data("ifnb")
res2 <- ProbScorer(ifnb@assays$RNA$counts, PathwaySet = "Metabolism")

unique(ifnb@meta.data$stim)
res3 <- ProbScorer(ifnb@assays$RNA$counts, method = "zinb",batch = ifnb@meta.data$stim, offset = ifnb@meta.data$nCount_RNA, PathwaySet = "Human Diseases",maxit = 50, ncores = 4)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
